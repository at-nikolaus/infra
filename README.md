# infra
Nils Infra is a NodeJS Written Fork of moby/infrakit it aims to supply you with the same features but be more extensible

is a toolkit for infrastructure orchestration. With an emphasis on immutable infrastructure, it breaks down infrastructure automation and management processes into small, pluggable components. These components work together to actively ensure the infrastructure state matches the user's specifications. nils-infra therefore provides infrastructure support for higher-level container & Other orchestration systems and can make your infrastructure self-managing and self-healing.
